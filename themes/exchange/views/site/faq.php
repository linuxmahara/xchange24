New – Your transaction is new in the system and it will be approved once we receive the confirmation from the payment processors that your transaction is not fraudulent.<br>
Pending - You transaction has been put on-hold by the payment processor (applicable only to STP and AP). You may want to contact the payment processor in question and see the reasons for the delay since they won't share them with us but only with the client. For STP get in touch with Investigations dept. at investigations@solidtrustpay.com.<br>
Approved – We approved your transaction and in a short time we will complete the exchange (based on your current level).<br>
